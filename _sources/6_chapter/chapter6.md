# Case study 6: Living lab in metropolitan area. 

Author: Yan Wang

## Project background

The researcher is studying bike theft in the Netherlands. 

In cooperation with a private company, the researcher wants to test a tracking system to uncover where stolen bikes go. The outcome is supposed to be used by relevant stakeholders such as local government bodies, or the police forces. 

The protocol involves setting trackers in 100 old bicylces and placing them in areas that are known for bike theft. Then the researchers track the movement of each bike. Conclusions are then drawn from the movement patterns.

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection and storage

For each bike, the following information is collected: 
- time stamp and current location
- identify potential business places (2nd hand shops)

The process shall continue until tracking devices break down, or run out battery.

Data are shared between the partner and the university. The data storage at the university is encrypted and the data transfer is done using specific tools. 

The information that will be made publicly available is aggregated data (meta-level report). Locations will be ``blurred'' in the report. 

#### Key considerations on data collection and storage
- The data collection process involves 24/7 monitoring of the bikes, requiring the appropriate infrastructure. 
- The amount of data collected shouldn't be too big (within the range of GB). 

### Ethics 

This type of activity implies monitoring of human activities without participant's (bike thieves) knowledge of it. This counts as "deception", and therefore may require additional review or documents for the institutional review board. 

Additionally, this relates to criminal activities, and therefore additional care will be given to such cases.

Despite being indirect witnesses to illegal activities, it was considered that reporting to the authorities was not necessary as the thieves could not directly be identified. 

#### Key considerations on ethics

- Because of the nature of the project (criminal activities and deception), it is advised to go to check with the relevant support team (ethics) as soon as possible to ensure minimal delays once the project is started. 

### Privacy and legal aspects

Because of the sensitive nature of the collected data (semi-criminal data) and the constant monitoring of activities, a review by the appropriate privacy team is required. Such a study may require a Data Protection Impact Assesment (DPIA) to be performed. That process will determine the degree of sensitivity of the information from a GDPR perspective. For this study, a DPIA was indeed required.

Additionally, since the data are not collected directly by the university, but the partner, a data transfer agreement must be put in place - since, without having much personal detail about bike thieves, we do track their location through several days - and hence, are in a position to re-identify the individual with minimal effort. 

#### Key considerations on privacy and legal aspects

- Because of the nature of the project (criminal activities and deception), it is advised to go to check with the relevant support team (privacy) as soon as possible to ensure minimal delays once the project is started.
