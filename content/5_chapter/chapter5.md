# Case study 5: MSc student thesis: A commercial internship project involving personal data collection 

Author: Nicolas Dintzner

## Project background

A MSc student is studying the barrier to the adoption of low carbon technologies in the domain of banking industry. 

In partnership with a large national Bank (Bank A), in which the student is performing his internship, the student will interview partners and customers of that bank, to gather their input on how they see the bank apply such technologies. Additionally, the student will run several interviews in other banking insitutions, and citizen associations.

The student is also performing an internship within the Bank A. He will benefit from the expertise of this company supervisor in analysing the data,

The work takes place over 6 months.

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection and storage

For each interview, we expect to collect audio recording, notes and a technical summary will be produced based on the content of the interview.

Part of the data collection will be done jointly between the student and the company supervisor - but not all. Only interviews with partners and customer of Bank A. 
It is understood that, for those specific interview, the Bank A already has access to some personal data (at least contact information) of the participants. 

However, for interviews with other stakeholder, the student will be on his/her own. 

All data should be stored at the University. Only data collected in partnership with Bank A should accessible to the company supervisor. However, all summaries should be anonymous and can be shared with all the supervisory team (university and Bank A alike) to fuel technical discussion. 

### Ethics

Most participants to interviews are going to be adults, and employees of banks or their partner institutions. We do not expect the participants to be vulnerable in that regard. 

However, their views regarding the company they work for, or the banking sector as a whole, could have a negative impact on them, and should therefore be kept within the University - and not shared, if possible, with Bank A. 

Consent documents must be used for all interviews - including those performed within Bank A. This can be a challenge, as the bank is used to collect information from their partner without explicit consent document. This may come across as unusual in a business context, but considering the student will get data from various groups, it is much easier to handle all those input in a consistent manner - i.e. with consent forms.

The consent form should be particularly clear regarding who will have access to the raw data (recording). 

### Privacy and legal aspects

The consent document will ensure that the data collection is done based on the participant explicit consent. 

In this instance, a few points are particularly important: who will have access to the raw data, and the purpose of processing. 
The student must ensure that the data is not shared beyond the research team (at the university), and that the data collected in partnership with the company is not used for other purposes. 

The data collected during meeting with Bank A partner's may be used by Bank A for other purposes. This only applies to meetings in which Bank A is directly involved. The members of Bank A are in charge of properly informing participants of what they will do with the data, and the student will do the same for his/her part of the work.

## Advice (process)

- explicit consent may be difficult to obtain in a company setting when meetings with partners and customers are common place - signing forms before a regular work meeting is an unusual practice. 
- because the MSc thesis is public, we need those consent form to ensure compliance with both ethical regulations and legal rules.
