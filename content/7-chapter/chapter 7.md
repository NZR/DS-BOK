# Case study 7: Tracer update

Author: Judith Brands and Qian Zhang

## Project background

This research project is aiming at assessing diagnostic tool efficiency, based on previously collected medical information. The principal investigator 
is a staff member of the hospital, who also conducts research in partnership with a university.

For this project, the goal was to evaluate imaging quality and tracer usage to diagnose patients with cancer, as a retrospective study.

This project will generate data regarding tracer uptake in specific organs, and a qualitative assessments of the resulting scan. 
Based on this, the suitability of the tracer/scan for diagnostic purposes can be evaluated.

## Research data management considerations

### Data collection and storage

In this project, the research team expects to re-use scans that were done on patients over time. 
All datasets have been pseudo-anonymized before being shared with the principal investigator of the project, however, due to the medical nature of the data, re-identification is a possibility. The datasets contain:
  - medical history (past diagnosis and treatments)
  - Patient characteristics (age/sex)
  - Imaging data

All datasets are being made available to the principal investigator via the hospital data storage system. No data is transferred between institutions during and after research. Since medical information falls under the special category of personal data, all accesses to the data remain restricted after research.  

According to the contract, all derived datasets which may contain personal data must be destroyed. All derived datasets must be anonymized before being published.

#### Key considerations on data collection and storage
- Personal data which is not neccessary for the project should not be shared beyond the study team at the hospital if there is no specific need to share this data with other actors of the project. 
- Data transfer shall be minimized/avoided for pseudonumized data- In this specific project, data remained within the hospital network, and accessed with respect to established security measures of the hospital.

### Ethics 

According to the Wet medischp-wetenschappelijke onderzoek met mensen act (WMO), medical research involving humans should be assessed by an accredited METC or a CCMO in advance (before collecting data). 

#### Key considerations on Ethics
- Medical ethical approval (WMO) shall be obtained in advance.


### Privacy & legal aspects

  In this project, personal data is going to be processed, therefore, researchers should comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR; the European privacy law). At the university, anyone who processes personal data should register the personal data in a GDPR form which will be checked by the university data protection officer. Informed consent was used to ensure that the personal data was used in accordance to the data subject wishes. 
  Since the researcher has double affiliation (the UMC as the first affiliation and the university as the second), it is important to determine the ownership of the data in advance. This can be specified in a contract between the UMC and the university. In this instance, the data was considered to be the property of the hospital.
  
All activities related to medical data must be framed by contracts. In this case, the principal investigator is an employee of the hospital, and therefore bound by the rules and regulations of the institute.

#### Key considerations on Privacy and legal aspects
- Pseudonymized medical data is considered sensitive personal data, therefore GDPR applies. It is important to have the processing of this types of data checked by a data protection officer. 
- Data ownership shall be discussed and determined in advance to prevent future conflicts when multiple parties are involved in a project or when the principal investigator of a project is affiliated with multiple organizations. This should be outlined in a contract or consortium/data sharing agreement which is approved by a legal advisor. 

## Advice (process)

In this instance, given the sensitivity of the data, it is recommened to follow all process, university and hospital, to the letter. 
The DMP must be very precise as to what data will be used, and where it is stored. 

In addition to Ethics oversight, additional input from the privacy/legal team, regarding the safeguarding of the data may be required. In such cases, a Data Protection Impact Assessment may be requested.
It is important for actors of this project to have a known protocol to follow in case of data loss or data leak.
